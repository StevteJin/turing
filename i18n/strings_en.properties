a41=Self-organizing business alliance, points exchange, rights and interests sharing. Promoting the liquidity of business passes is widely used in games, e-commerce, social networking, finance and other fields.
a42=Turing Public Chain will adopt Nominated Rights Certification (NPOS), a new POS scheme to select which verifiers can participate in the verification of conformance protocol, and to protect network security through stake mining.
a43=Supports one-click issuance of passports, and adopts a secure hosting scheme. Users seamlessly use blockchains. We will hand over the responsibility of keeping the private key for the user to the super node. Through the use of Turing Public Chain Management Background and SDK, super nodes can generate public chain addresses and private keys for their own users in batches, and chain the integral rights in their own APP.
a44=Self-organizing business alliance, points exchange, rights and interests sharing. Promoting the liquidity of business passes is widely used in games, e-commerce, social networking, finance and other fields.
a45=Node itself is application, business and Turing's overall ecological prosperity. Digital application services such as games, e-commerce, social networking, finance and other industries can be applied to become super nodes. Enjoy the incentive of ecological development while expanding business.
a46=At any given time, we expect a considerable amount of Tur supply to be stored in NPoS. This makes it difficult for the evil entity to get enough votes to be elected as a verifier, and the cost of attacking the system is very high, which effectively prevents the token centralization of the POS blockchain.
a47=Based on the substrate, the main network of Polkadot is connected through bridge chain. New blockchains based on these protocols can send transactions and transmit messages between chains. When all blockchains are connected and interoperable, it will bring more capital, better user experience, and more conducive to brainstorming and improving the network state.
a48=The basic principle of chain governance is that all protocol level changes must pass a referendum, and those who have more votes will have the right to speak on the Internet. With the chain governance model, all decisions are voted by the Turing currency community, and the chain code is executed without any ambiguity.
